I have made a an image segmentation project which use coresets and K Means clustering which is an unsupervised machine algorithm to create a segmented image of the input image as an output. In the project, we were given a 'fruit.jpg' file for testing the model and it created an output 'fruit_segmented.png' file.
I have also given the output image in the repository so that the user can see both the input and the output image.

# Image Segmentation Project Report( Problem Statement-3)

## Project Overview

The "Image Segmentation" project aims to develop a robust solution for segmenting images into distinct regions based on pixel characteristics bu using K Means Clustering algorithm and coresets.

## Objectives

- To implement an image segmentation solution that can accurately partition an image into segments based on similarities in color or texture.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of KMeans clustering in image segmentation tasks.
- To optimize the segmentation process for better accuracy and efficiency.

### Image Pre-processing

1. Loading Images: Images are loaded into the Python environment using the Pillow library, which allows for easy manipulation of pixel data.
2. Data Conversion: Image data is converted to NumPy arrays to facilitate numerical operations essential for the segmentation process.

### Segmentation Process

1. KMeans Clustering: The Scikit-learn library's KMeans algorithm is employed to cluster pixel data. This step is critical for identifying unique segments within the image.
   - Initialization: 'k-means++' is used for initializing cluster centers to improve convergence.
   - Clustering: Pixels are assigned to clusters based on their proximity to these centers.

2. Image Reconstruction: Post clustering, the image is reconstructed from the segmented data, ensuring that each segment is visually distinct. This involves converting the clustered data back into an image format compatible with standard image files.
3. Coresets: These are small summaries of large data sets â€” so that solutions found on the summary are provably competitive with solution found on the full data set.

### Post-processing and Output

1. Data Type Conversion: Segmented image data is converted to a uint8 type, ensuring it matches the standard image format for pixel values.
2. Image Saving: The segmented image is saved using Pillow, with considerations for format compatibility and quality.
3. Output Image: An output image was generated by converting the segmented_image data in the form of array into a picture.

## Key Decisions and Solutions

- Choosing KMeans for Segmentation: This was given in the problem statement.
- Image Data Handling: Converting images to NumPy arrays was crucial for enabling the computational operations required for clustering. Ensuring data types were compatible across different stages of the process was essential for maintaining image quality.
- Optimizing Cluster Initialization: Utilizing the 'k-means++' initialization method for KMeans significantly improved the reliability of clustering results by reducing the likelihood of poor cluster center starts.

## Challenges and Solutions

Implementation of algorithms: It was a tough challenge to actually code 'D squared sampling' and 'coreset construction' and it took a major portion of my time in developing a solution for the problem statement.
Image Generation: Creating an output image after image segmentation was also challenging for me and I had to code it for multiple times unless I got the output image.
## Results and Conclusion

The project successfully implemented an image segmentation solution using KMeans Clustering using the knowledge of Coresets.
